This program is designed to be a super simple, portable manager for libraries
of CDs. It is more or less an example of file and linked list operations, and
is not practical for daily use.

--------

1. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT FILES:

main.c:
    Main source file, contains all definitions for this project.

database.txt:
    Example database. Contains albums formatted as a single entry per line,
artist, album, year separated by spaces, spaces in strings replaced with _,
and _ replaced with \, just in case.

Makefile:
    Makefile for GNU make(1), builds with cc(1) for Linux operating systems.
The project should compile and run as is on Windows, but you are on your own.
(I recommend using Visual C++ Express; it's free and works adequately.)

2. BUILDING THIS PROJECT:

    For GNU/Linux operating systems, make(1) can be used to compile. Be advised
that the default build mode will link debugging symbols for gdb(1); to build a
distributable version, type 'make release'.

    On Windows, this project will compile, but you will likely be unable to use
make unless you have cygwin'd it in. Import the source file into your favorite
IDE and compile normally.
